# Personal Configuration Files

This repository is a collection of **personal configuration files** such as *vim*, *VS Code*, or *Claude Code* to make setting up a new machine easier. All the configurations are free to use by everyone who stumbles upon this repository, including my personal *Claude Code* files that are tailor-made to suit my needs.
